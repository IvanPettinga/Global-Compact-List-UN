# About the UN Global Compact List
The UN Global Compact is a voluntary initiative that seeks to advance universal principles on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption through the active engagement of the corporate community, in cooperation with civil society and representatives of organized labour. Our initiative is not designed, nor does it have the mandate or resources, to monitor or measure participantsâ€™ performance. Nevertheless, with the aim of assuring that the integrity of the Global Compact is safeguarded at all times, the UN Secretary-General has adopted a set of integrity measures.

The measures are in place to protect the integrity of the initiative and the UN from key risks associated with the potential for misrepresentation. These integrity measures are aimed at promoting greater public accountability and transparency of participants for their corporate sustainability performance and are comprised of our reporting policies, logo policy and dialogue facilitation process. Implementation of the integrity measures is overseen by the UN Global Compact Board.
